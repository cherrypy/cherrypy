# `git blame` master ignore list.
#
# This file contains a list of git hashes of revisions to be ignored
# by `git blame`. These revisions are considered "unimportant" in
# that they are unlikely to be what you are interested in when blaming.
# They are typically expected to be formatting-only changes.
#
# It can be used for `git blame` using `--ignore-revs-file` or by
# setting `blame.ignoreRevsFile` in the `git config`[1].
#
# Ignore these commits when reporting with blame. Calling
#
#   git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# will tell `git blame` to ignore changes made by these revisions when
# assigning blame, as if the change never happened.
#
# You can enable this as a default for your local repository by
# running
#
#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# This will probably be automatically picked by your IDE
# (VSCode+GitLens and JetBrains products are confirmed to do this).
#
# Important: if you are switching to a branch without this file,
# `git blame` will fail with an error.
#
# GitHub also excludes the commits listed below from its "Blame"
# views[2][3].

# Guidelines:
# - Only large (generally automated) reformatting or renaming PRs
#   should be added to this list. Do not put things here just because
#   you feel they are trivial or unimportant. If in doubt, do not put
#   it on this list.
# - When adding a single revision, use a comment on top of the line
#   to link relevant issue/PR. Alternatively, paste the commit title
#   instead.
#   Example:
#     # https://github.com/sanitizers/octomachinery/issues/1
#     d4a8b7307acc2dc8a8833ccfa65426ad28b3ffc9
# - When adding multiple revisions (like a bulk of work over many
#   commits), organize them in blocks. Precede each such block with a
#   comment starting with the word "START", followed by a link to the
#   relevant issue or PR. Add a similar comment after the last block
#   line but use the word "END", followed by the same link.
#   Alternatively, add or augment the link with a text motivation and
#   description of work performed in each commit.
#   Before each individual commit in the block, add an inline comment
#   with the commit title line.
#   Example:
#     # START https://github.com/sanitizers/octomachinery/issues/1
#     # Bulk-replace smile emojis with unicorns
#     6f0bd2d8a1e6cd2e794cd39976e9756e0c85ac66
#     # Replace double with single quotes
#     d53974df11dbc22cbea9dc7dcbc9896c25979a27
#     ... <rest of the list>
#     # END https://github.com/sanitizers/octomachinery/issues/1
# - Only put full 40-character hashes on this list (not short hashes
#   or any other revision reference).
# - Append to the bottom of the file, regardless of the chronological
#   order of the revisions. Revisions within blocks should be in
#   chronological order from oldest to newest.
# - Because you must use a hash, you need to append to this list in a
#   follow-up PR to the actual reformatting PR that you are trying to
#   ignore. This approach helps avoid issues with arbitrary rebases
#   and squashes while the pull request is in progress.
